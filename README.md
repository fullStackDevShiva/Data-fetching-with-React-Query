## Data Fetching Using React Query

This small project primarily includes the setup and use of React-Query library (TanStack Query) for advanced data fetching with real world scenarios.

## Functionality

Three different frontend API calls for data fetching (list of users) with real world scenarios.

1. Basic query - to fetch all users at once and list them
2. Paginated query - to enable pagination with the list
3. Infinite query - to enable infinite loading with the list

Note: Open source mock backend APIs from http://dummmyjson.com have been used for this purpose.
